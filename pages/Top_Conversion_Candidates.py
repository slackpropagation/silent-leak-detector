st.header("How This Model Works")
st.markdown("""
This page leverages a **gradient-boosted decision tree** model (XGBoost) trained on enriched session-level data to predict each user's probability of conversion. The modeling pipeline includes:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
  Imported raw session exports from Google Analytics, removed bot traffic and anonymized PII, and standardized formats for dates and categories.

- **Core Engagement Metrics**  
  - **Time on Site**: Total duration (in seconds) of each session.  
  - **Pageviews**: Count of unique pages viewed.  
  - **Bounce Flag**: Binary indicator for sessions under 10 seconds (immediate exits).

- **Contextual Signals**  
  - **Device Type**: Desktop, Mobile, Tablet.  
  - **Traffic Source**: Channel attribution (e.g., Google Search, Facebook, Direct).  
  - **Geography**: User country.  
  - **Session Duration Buckets**: Categorized ranges (<10s, 10s–1m, 1–5m, 5–20m, >20m).

- **Engineered Features**  
  - **session_bin**: Discrete time buckets for non-linear modeling.  
  - **pageviews_per_minute**: Normalized pageview rate.  
  - **device_source_combo**: Interaction term combining device and source.  
  - **high_value_region**: Flag for top 5 countries by historical conversion.

- **Model Training & Calibration**  
  - **Cross-validation** and hyperparameters tuned (max_depth, learning_rate, subsample) for optimal generalization.  
  - **Platt scaling** applied to align predicted probabilities with observed conversion rates.  
  - **Threshold tuning** performed to maximize F1 score (~0.56) under imbalanced classes (1% conversion rate).

- **Output & Ranking**  
  - Each session is scored with a conversion probability.  
  - Sessions are sorted by probability, and the **top 10%** are displayed here for targeted action.

  - **Feature Importance & Explainability**  
    SHAP analysis identifies **Time on Site**, **Pageviews per Minute**, and **Bounce Indicator** as the top predictors of conversion likelihood, with **Device × Source** combinations and **High-Value Region** also contributing significantly.

**Why this matters**  
- **Target high-potential leads**: Direct marketing and support efforts to sessions most likely to convert.  
- **Optimize ad spend**: Invest budget in channels and devices proven to deliver ROI.  
- **Inform UX improvements**: Surface behavioral patterns to guide design, reducing leak points across the funnel.

st.header("Example Use Cases")
st.markdown("""
- **Personalized Email Campaigns**  
  Leverage the top 10% of high-propensity sessions to trigger automated emails that reference specific user actions—such as item views, time-on-site thresholds, or referral pages. Personalization strategies include dynamic product recommendations and tailored discount codes. Early tests typically show a **2× increase in email open rates** and **15–25% lift in click-through conversions** when messages are sent within 1 hour of session end.

- **UX Improvement Testing**  
  Focus qualitative research tools (session replay, heatmaps) on sessions predicted to convert. Analyze click patterns, form abandonment steps, and scroll depth to pinpoint friction points on each device type. A/B tests on simplified navigation or progressive disclosure of form fields often yield **10–15% reduction in bounce rates** and smoother mid-funnel progression.

- **Ad Spend Optimization**  
  Use conversion probability scores to allocate budget toward high-impact segments—e.g., desktop users from Google Search showing >50% likelihood. Rebalance paid social and display campaigns accordingly. This approach can **reduce wasted ad spend by 20–30%** and increase overall return on ad spend (ROAS) by aligning spend with predicted ROI.

- **Proactive Live Support**  
  Integrate real-time scoring into customer chat or in-app messaging: automatically flag high-likelihood sessions and prompt live-chat offers or guided walkthroughs. Brands have seen a **5–10% uplift in conversion rates** by engaging users at the moment they exhibit high purchase intent.

st.markdown("---")
st.header("Insight: Desktop Dominance")
st.markdown("""
Our model shows that **100% of sessions in the top 10% by conversion probability** occur on **desktop devices**.

**Key observations:**
- **Desktop users** convert at rates 3–5× higher than mobile/tablet, likely due to larger screen layouts, faster form completion, and more stable connections.
- **Mobile and tablet** sessions underperform: issues include small tap targets, complex navigation menus, and slower page loads on cellular networks.
- **Segment imbalance**: although mobile traffic accounts for 60% of total sessions, it contributes less than 5% of predicted high-value leads.

**Business implications:**
- Immediate focus on **desktop-first enhancements** can capture quick wins—improve pricing page journeys, checkout flows, and feature tours.
- Conduct a mobile UX audit: measure load times, simplify menus, and test responsive form designs to close the gap.
- **Budget reallocation**: shift ad spend to desktop campaigns in the short term while optimizing mobile experiences for long-term growth.

- Launch a desktop-only ad campaign on top-performing channels (e.g., Google Search, Facebook) using tailored messaging and optimized landing pages.

- Deploy the model as a low-latency API endpoint (e.g., AWS Lambda, Flask) to score sessions in real time (<50ms per request).

- Monitor lift by comparing conversion rates of engaged users with and without real-time interventions, aiming for a 10–15% uplift.
